    "This notebook represents the **Evaluation and Recommendations** phase of the TravelTide segmentation project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous notebooks transformed raw session-level data into a user-level view, defined a rule-based segmentation framework grounded in behavioral logic, and validated it through unsupervised clustering.   \n",
    "That work established four stable behavioral dimensions, **Value, Risk, Complexity, and Engagement**, and used them to assign exactly one perk per user through explicit eligibility and priority rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is not to introduce new segments or models, but to **evaluate whether the resulting perk strategy is the right one to act on**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook:\n",
    "- assesses whether perk assignment aligns with real behavioral frictions,\n",
    "- evaluates risk exposure and economic efficiency,\n",
    "- and translates analytical findings into concrete recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "All analysis is therefore framed around **decisions**, trade-offs, and next steps, rather than further exploration."
